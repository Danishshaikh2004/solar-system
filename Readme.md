# 3D Solar System using Three.js

This is a small project I made for my frontend development internship assignment.  
It shows a simple 3D solar system with the Sun in the center and 8 planets orbiting around it.

---

## What it does

- Shows the Sun and all 8 planets (from Mercury to Neptune)
- All planets move around the Sun in circles
- Each planet can have its own speed (you can change it using sliders)
- There's a Pause and Resume button to stop or continue the animation

---

## How to run it

1. Download the project folder (or unzip it)
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. That's it! You should see the solar system working

---

## What I used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D graphics

---

## Extra features I added

- You can control how fast each planet moves
- The orbit paths of planets are also visible
